# Docker_Github_Actions_AWS_App


This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build a Dockerized Python application and deploy it to an AWS EC2 instance.

## Workflow

![Streamlit -app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39ad53f3-2c5c-489d-8ada-dd2af9a75d60)


1. **Code Commit**: Developers push code changes to the `main` branch.
2. **CI Build Job**: GitHub Actions triggers a build job (`build.yml`) upon code commit.
3. **Docker Image Build**: The CI job builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile and pushes it to Docker Hub upon successful build.
4. **CD Deploy Job**: After the image is pushed, another GitHub Actions job (`deploy.yml`) is triggered.
5. **Deployment to AWS EC2**:
   - The deploy job uses a self-hosted runner on an AWS EC2 instance.
   - It pulls the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
   - The image is then run as a container on the EC2 instance.

## Repository Structure

- **`.github/workflows/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows.
  - `build.yml`: Defines CI build steps.
  - `deploy.yml`: Defines CD deployment steps.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Configuration for building the Docker image.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (you are currently reading this file).

## Prerequisites

Before running the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have set up the following:

- **GitHub Repository**: Configure secrets for Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) as Repo Secrets.
- **Docker Hub Account**: Repository for storing Docker images.
- **AWS EC2 Instance**: Ensure the instance is running and accessible via SSH.and Configured Self-Hosted Runner

## Usage

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Set GitHub Secrets**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.
4. **Configure a Self hosted Runner** : Go to Settings > Actions > Self-hosted runners.
4. **Push to `main` Branch**: Push your changes to the `main` branch to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Monitor Execution**: View the progress of the CI/CD pipeline in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
6. **Verify Deployment**: Access your AWS EC2 instance to verify that the Docker container is running successfully.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Dockerfile is configured correctly to build and run your Python application.
- Regularly monitor and maintain your AWS EC2 instance to ensure proper functioning of the deployed application.
